Hello My name is Vladimir I am from Barnaul Now I live in St. Petersburg. I graduated from omgups electromechanical faculty, this is a railway university in OMSK.

Worked as a railroad engineer And I realized that I want to change the sphere. Moved to  St. Petersburg And i started working at the factory as an engineer, but this also did not bring me pleasure.

I decided to do website development in the evenings. At first I studied from YouTube videos, then I went through the free HTML Academy trainers.

Later, I found a metalamp self-study course. There was a very large layout with logic that seemed to deepen my knowledge of JavaScript

 24th February came and I decided to quit my job and go abroad and deepen my studies. I did this project and responded to the vacancy. Planned to find a job in this area and work abroad.

Employers invited me to a personal meeting several times, but since I was not in Russia, the meetings did not take place. I understand. That the first remote job will be difficult to find and return back to Russia after two months of living in Georgia and Turkey

After returning, I found a job in IT, but this is not an IT company. I made several sites and completed a third-party order to create a furniture website written in alpine.js.

I learn about rs.school and completed Stage zero successful 

I know how to optimize websites for lighthouse, I know pug, scss, javascript, webpack, node.js a little. i can restore websites using webarchive.

 My plans to improve my English level, I started learning it when I left Russia I want to learn typescript and delve into the study of some framework.

I tend to get addicted to things and in the past I was addicted to computer games now I am addicted to programming 

Thank you for your attention.
